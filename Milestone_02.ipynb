In addition to being the most accurate, Random Forest was also the most stable, with the lowest standard deviation (≈ $1,297), indicating consistent performance across cross-validation folds. The near-identical results between Linear and Ridge models suggest minimal improvement from regularization, possibly due to limited multicollinearity in the dataset. While Random Forest’s lower MAE suggests strong predictive ability, further evaluation on test data is needed to assess potential overfitting. At this stage, however, there are no strong signs of underfitting, as all models show reasonably low error and consistent CV performance."

    "The addition of engineered features had only a modest impact on model performance. Random Forest showed a slight improvement in mean MAE (from ~$165,880 to ~$166,015), which is within the range of natural variation and suggests that the new features did not significantly enhance its predictive power. Linear and Ridge Regression showed virtually no change, with MAEs remaining around ~$193,155. Among the engineered features, the bedroom-bathroom interaction term was the most conceptually promising, as it reflects how functional space might influence home value. However, it likely did not help linear models due to the absence of strong linear correlation with the target. The log-transformed lot size and squared finished square footage were aimed at addressing skewness and nonlinear relationships, but their limited effect suggests that either the original models were already capturing these patterns adequately, or that the engineered features introduced redundancy. Overall, the results highlight that while feature engineering can be valuable, its effectiveness often depends on the model’s ability to capture nonlinear or complex relationships."

Both Linear Regression (with forward selection) and Ridge Regression (with backward selection) showed slightly lower MAE scores compared to their full-feature counterparts, indicating a potential benefit from removing less informative or redundant features. However, Random Forest performance slightly decreased after selecting only the top 10 features, suggesting it may benefit from having access to a broader feature space due to its ability to handle noisy data.\n",
